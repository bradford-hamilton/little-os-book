; We could point esp to a random area in memory since, so far, the only thing in
; the memory is GRUB, BIOS, the OS kernel and some memory-mapped I/O. This is not
; a good idea - we donâ€™t know how much memory is available or if the area esp
; would point to is used by something else. A better idea is to reserve a piece
; of uninitialized memory in the bss section in the ELF file of the kernel. It
; is better to use the bss section instead of the data section to reduce the size
; of the OS executable. Since GRUB understands ELF, GRUB will allocate any memory
; reserved in the bss section when loading the OS.
